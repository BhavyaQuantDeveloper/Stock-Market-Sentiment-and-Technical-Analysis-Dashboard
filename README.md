# Stock-Market-Sentiment-and-Technical-Analysis-Dashboard
Built a cloud-based finance tool in Python using Google Colab. Pulled stock data via Alpha Vantage API, calculated SMA, RSI, and MACD using ta, and visualized it with interactive Plotly charts. Enables technical analysis and trend insights in a fully modular workflow.

A little bit more about this project:

In this project, I developed a finance analytics pipeline using Python within the Google Colab environment, allowing for cloud-based, interactive analysis without requiring local setup. The primary goal was to perform time series analysis and technical indicator-based evaluation on equity market data. The project begins by installing core Python libraries — namely, `alpha_vantage` for API access to real-time and historical market data, `pandas` for DataFrame manipulation and preprocessing, `ta` (Technical Analysis library) for quantitative signal generation, and `plotly.graph_objects` for building high-fidelity, interactive data visualizations.

Using the Alpha Vantage Time Series API, daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data was fetched for a given equity symbol (e.g., Apple Inc., ticker: AAPL). The data was extracted in Pandas DataFrame format by specifying `output_format='pandas'`, which enabled immediate downstream compatibility with analytical functions. The time series data was then sorted chronologically, and key technical indicators were computed using the `ta` library, leveraging vectorized operations over the 'Close' price series. Specifically, I calculated the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA_50) to capture medium-term price trends, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) to measure momentum and detect potential overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) market conditions, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator to identify trend direction and reversals based on the convergence/divergence of fast and slow EMAs.

To visualize the data, I implemented interactive charts using Plotly. The primary visualization was a multi-trace candlestick chart — constructed via `go.Candlestick()` — that overlaid price action with SMA lines for trend analysis. This allowed for dynamic user interaction including zooming, panning, and hover tooltips for precise data inspection. Additionally, RSI values were plotted using a secondary line chart with a fixed y-axis range [0, 100] to emphasize extreme momentum signals. This modular structure not only supports real-time visualization of technical indicators but also lays the groundwork for more advanced applications such as dynamic multi-asset dashboards, signal backtesting frameworks, or integration with ML-based trading algorithms.

Overall, this project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for financial time series analysis — from API data ingestion, preprocessing, and feature engineering (via TA indicators), to interactive exploration using Plotly — all contained within a reproducible and portable Jupyter Notebook environment on Google Colab. The architecture is extensible and can accommodate additional features like intraday data, rolling correlation analysis, multi-ticker comparisons, or sentiment integration via NLP on financial news.
